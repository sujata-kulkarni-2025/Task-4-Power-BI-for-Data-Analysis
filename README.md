🛍️ Sales by Item:
Top-selling categories:

Fruits and Vegetables

Dairy Products

Snacks

Beverages

Core demand lies in essentials and convenience foods. Strategic pricing or bundling here may boost repeat purchases.

🏪 Sales by Outlet:
Top Outlets (Outlet 1 and Outlet 3) are contributing the highest sales, well over 0.3M each.

Focus efforts on replicating success factors (location, inventory mix, service quality) of these outlets across others.

🧱 Outlet Size Breakdown:
Medium Outlets: 42.27%

Small Outlets: 37.01%

High Outlets: 20.72%

Majority of the outlets are either medium or small. Since medium outlets dominate in both count and (likely) performance, they might represent the optimal balance of cost and coverage.

✅ Recommendations:
Push Low-Fat Products: Increase visibility/offers to balance health-conscious segment demand.

Investigate Post-2019 Dip: Identify reasons for the drop in 2020–2021 and adapt accordingly.

Leverage High-Performing Outlets: Analyze what’s working in Outlet 1 & 3 and scale best practices.

Customer Feedback: With a 3.92 average rating, improving delivery speed, packaging, or app experience may push this toward 4.5+.

Product Focus: Strengthen inventory and promotions around top-selling items for higher returns.
